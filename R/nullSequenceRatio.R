#### Backward:
# y and t are vectors of the same length

# this is calculating the sum of y depending on t.
# for ith position, it looks at the ith value of t. Look back in t to find the minimum index
# of t such that the difference is less than or equal to delta. Say this index is j
# then for the ith position, it is summing y from j to i-1. By default/design the 1st entry is 0.

#### Forward:
# y and t are vectors of the same length
# t is again non decreasing
# this is calculating the sum of y depending on t.
# for ith position, it looks at the ith value of t. Look forward in t to find the maximum index
# of t such that the difference is less than or equal to delta. Say this index is j
# then for the ith position, it is summing y from i+1 to j. By default/design the last entry is 0.
