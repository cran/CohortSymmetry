\title{A plot for the sequence ratios.}
\usage{
plotSequenceRatios(
  result,
  onlyASR = FALSE,
  plotTitle = NULL,
  labs = c("SR", "Drug Pairs"),

\arguments{
\item{result}{Table output from summariseSequenceRatios.}

\item{onlyASR}{If set to be TRUE then only adjusted SR will be plotted.
Otherwise if it is set to be FALSE then both adjusted and crude SR will be plotted.}

\item{plotTitle}{Title of the plot, if NULL no title will be included in the plot.}

\item{labs}{Axis labels for the plot.}

\item{colours}{Colours for sequence ratio.}

\item{facet}{The variable to facet by.}
}
\value{
A plot for the sequence ratios of index and marker cohorts.
}
\description{
It provides a ggplot of the sequence ratios of index and marker cohorts.
